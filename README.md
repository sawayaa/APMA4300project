# Replication-of-ML-Paper-on-Migration

In this project, I attempt to replicate a model for migration by Robinson et al.'s paper "A Machine Learning Approach to Modeling Human Migration" (2017). In this paper run multiple models to track migration based off of IRS migration datasets on counties and compare errors between them. They cover traditional models such as gravity and radiation models with their own productive functions, a boosting gradient, and an artificial neural network. Alternatively, due to the scope of this project, I will only be focusing on one, which is the deep learning artificial neural network. They used the neural network builder offered by Keras, so I will be applying the same library to help solve this problem.
